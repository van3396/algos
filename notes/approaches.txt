How to improve:
    1.  DEVISE a plan for solving problems
    2.  MASTER common problem solving patterns

Problem solving:
    - understand the problem
        - can I restate the problem in my own words?
        - what are the inputs that go into the problem?
        - what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
        - can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
            - do I have enough information to solve the problem
        - how should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
=====================================================
Write a function which takes two number and returns their sum.

1. can I restate the problem in my own words?
    "implement addition"
2. what are the inputs that go into the problem?
    - ints?
    - floats?
    - what about strings for large numbers?
3. what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
    - int? float? string?
4. can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
    
5. how should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

=====================================================
    - explore concrete examples
=====================================================
Write a function which takes two number and returns their sum.

- start with simple examples

=====================================================
    - break it down
    - solve/simplify
    - look back and refactor
